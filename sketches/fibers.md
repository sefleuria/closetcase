__Fiber Composition Appearances__

This sample was drawn from recently worn or laundered pile and does not include any silks, out for dry cleaning. 

![Sketch of fiber frequencies in closet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7518937/7188093/47b767cc-e443-11e4-9388-8172e3b28a1a.png?raw=TRUE)

In this sketch you can see how frequently various fibers appear in my closet.
On a garment tag, the fibers are listed in order, hence some fabrics are considered "Primary", "Secondary", or "Tertiary" in this glass.
None of my items had more than three fabrics at a time.
Most of the wardrobe contains polyester, elastane (spandex) or cotton. Except, spandex is never a primary fiber. Fibers are ranked by percentage in the garment, so even though spandex appears the most it probable is the most rare fabric by weight.

Leather, Suede, and any Polyurethane-based fabric (patent leather, pleather, etc) don't technically get classified as fibers, but are included on this chart.
