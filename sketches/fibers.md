__Fiber Composition Appearances__

![Sketch of fiber frequencies in closet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7518937/7188093/47b767cc-e443-11e4-9388-8172e3b28a1a.png?raw=TRUE)

In this sketch you can see how frequently various fibers appear in my closet.
On a garment tag, the fibers are listed in order, hence some fabrics are considered "Primary", "Secondary", or "Tertiary" in this glass.
None of my items had more than three fabrics at a time.
Spandex is never a primary fiber. 
Most of the wardrobe contains cotton or polyester. This isn't to say most of the wardrobe is one or the other -- it depends on the percentages of each.

Note: This sample was drawn from recently worn or laundered pile and does not include any silks, out for dry cleaning. 
Note: Leather, Suede, and any Polyurethane based fabric (patent leather, pleather, etc) don't technically get classified as fiber
